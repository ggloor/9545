# Basic R

everything is a vector

or a list

or a function

we subset by [row, column]

make a simple vector

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=T}
# make three vectors using the c() function
x <- c(1,2,3) # this is a comment as well
y <- c(2,3,4)
z <- c(5,6)

# make a column-wise matrix
xy <- cbind(x,y)

# make a list including the matrix
xy.list <- list(x,y,z,xy)

# get the struture
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
